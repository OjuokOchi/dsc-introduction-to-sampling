Once we start working with actual datasets and real-world data collection limitations, we start to need additional statistical techniques in order to make inferences about populations. One of the foundational concepts involved is sampling, and how point estimates from samples help us to understand population statistics.\n","\n","## Objectives\n","\n","You will be able to:\n","\n","* Describe how samples are able to allow data scientists to gain insights to a population"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Census vs. Sample\n","\n","Rarely, if ever, are we able to completely survey a **population** of interest. Whatever we are trying to measure — asthma rates, fish populations, daily temperatures, material volumes, manufacturing defects — we are unlikely to have complete information about the system in question.\n","\n","If we performed a complete enumeration of all data points (e.g. testing every person in a population for asthma), that would be a **census**. Similar to the United States Census, our example census would be very expensive, and for some kinds of measurements it would be simply impossible.\n","\n","More realistically, data scientists are typically working with a **sample** that represents some subset of the population of interest. From that sample, we can calculate **point estimates** for measurements such as the mean. Then using our knowledge of statistical distributions, we are able to make inferences about about the true population statistics, without ever having to survey the entire population!\n","\n","### Connections to Previous Concepts\n","\n","These concepts tie in to the **set theory concepts** previously introduced:\n","\n","* The *population* is equivalent to the *universal set*. Just like a universal set, a population is not necessarily all possible things that have ever existed, it just means all possible things within some defined specification.\n","* The *sample* is a *subset* of this population. Every element in the sample is part of the population. In theory we could have a sample that includes every member of the population, but typically when we call something a \"sample\" we mean that it is a *proper subset* of the population (that the population contains additional members that are not part of the sample).\n","\n","Also, recall what we previously learned about **descriptive statistics**:\n","\n","* Statistical measures such as *measures of central tendency* (e.g. mean, median) and *measures of spread* (e.g. absolute deviation, standard deviation) are used to describe the *distribution* of a given collection of data points. We also use visualizations such as *histograms* and box plots to understand the shape of distributions.\n","* These descriptive statistics can apply to populations or samples. When they are applied to populations they are called *population statistics*, and when they are applied to samples they are called *point estimates*.\n","* In mathematical notation, we often use different symbols for a given statistic depending on whether it applies to the population or a sample. Some examples of those differences are listed below:\n","  * Number\n","    * $N$ is the number of individuals/cases in a population\n","    * $n$ is the number of individuals/cases in sample\n","  * Mean\n","    * $\\mu$ is the population mean (pronounced \"mu\")\n","    * $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean (pronounced \"x bar\")\n","  * Standard Deviation\n","    * $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation (pronounced \"sigma\")\n","    * $s$ is the sample standard deviation"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Case Study: Estimating Mean Age\n","\n","In the following example, let's say we are trying to estimate the **mean age of a population**.\n","\n","The population we'll use is quite small: people who were on board the Titanic (a classic \"toy dataset\").\n","\n","***Note:*** In this case, we actually do have data about the entire population, since it includes fewer than 1000 people. If you have access to a complete census like this, then you don't actually need to use statistical techniques to make statements about population parameters. But we are going to use this as an example because it will allow us to compare the mean age point estimates to the true population mean age.\n","\n","Let's start by importing the dataset."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>PassengerId</th>\n","      <th>Survived</th>\n","      <th>Pclass</th>\n","      <th>Name</th>\n","      <th>Sex</th>\n","      <th>Age</th>\n","      <th>SibSp</th>\n","      <th>Parch</th>\n","      <th>Ticket</th>\n","      <th>Fare</th>\n","      <th>Cabin</th>\n","      <th>Embarked</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>Braund, Mr. Owen Harris</td>\n","      <td>male</td>\n","      <td>22.0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>A/5 21171</td>\n","      <td>7.2500</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>S</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley (Florence Briggs Th...</td>\n","      <td>female</td>\n","      <td>38.0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>PC 17599</td>\n","      <td>71.2833</td>\n","      <td>C85</td>\n","      <td>C</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>Heikkinen, Miss.
